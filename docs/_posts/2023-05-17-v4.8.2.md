title: v4.8.2
type: patch
---

This release fixes a regression in the API server related to fetching of policy violations, which was introduced in 4.8.1.  
There are no changes for the frontend, the latest version of it remains 4.8.1.

**Fixes:**

* Fix policy violations endpoint erroneously returning violations for all projects when no `searchText` parameter is provided - [apiserver/#2766]
* Fix signals (e.g. `SIGTERM`) not being handled by the JVM process inside the container image, preventing graceful shutdown - [apiserver/#2750]
